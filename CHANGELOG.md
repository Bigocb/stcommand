# Changelog

Every notable change, newest first. One entry per merged change, written
for someone who wasn't in the room — what changed and why, not just what
the commit touched. Decisions with lasting architectural weight get their
own ADR in `docs/adr/` (see `docs/adr/README.md`) instead of just a line
here; link it from the entry when that happens.

Backfilled from git history starting 2026-09-12 going back far enough to
be useful context; not a complete project history — see `git log` for that.

## Unreleased

- Nothing pending yet — add entries here as work lands, then move them
  under a dated heading below on the next meaningful checkpoint.

## 2026-09-12 (route planner: proximity estimate instead of scan-only)

- **Reworked the Route Planner to always produce a route**, instead of
  coming up empty for the (very common) case where no tenant has ever
  scanned a gate connecting two systems. Operator request, after
  confirming a real assumption gap: not every system has a jump gate at
  all (`JUMP_GATE` is one waypoint type among several — a system may
  simply have none), so real gate connectivity can never be fully known
  without scanning every system. Per operator direction, the planner now
  deliberately assumes every system has a gate and estimates connectivity
  by physical proximity — each system links to its 6 nearest neighbors by
  raw galaxy x/y — then runs the same breadth-first shortest-hop search
  over that graph. Results are labeled "(estimated)" and the panel says
  plainly that it isn't confirmed against any tenant's scan data. The
  map's own jump-gate connection-line layer is unaffected — still real
  scanned data only, unchanged.

## 2026-09-12 (cartography bookmarks, connections, route planner)

- **Added system bookmarks to `/cartography`**, listed under the Activity
  card. Since this is a public, no-login page there's no account to hang
  a bookmark list off, so it's stored in the viewer's own browser
  (`localStorage`) — private to that browser, doesn't follow across
  devices, but that's the honest tradeoff for staying login-free. A ☆/★
  button next to the search box bookmarks whatever system is currently
  highlighted; clicking a bookmark jumps the map straight to it.
- **Added subtle jump-gate connection lines**, drawn between systems once
  zoomed in enough to read as structure rather than a solid mess (same
  zoom-threshold approach as the symbol labels). A connection where both
  endpoints are marked "explored" draws in blue instead of the default
  muted gray, to call out routes that are actually usable today (both
  ends known well enough to know they connect) versus a route only known
  from one side's scan. New `Store.listGalaxyJumpConnections()` and
  `GET /api/cartography/connections`, both deriving system-to-system
  pairs from `galaxy_systems.jump_gates` (again tenant-exploration data,
  never the crawler's own).
- **Added a Route Planner tab.** Two system inputs and a breadth-first
  search over the same jump-gate connection graph — hop-count-shortest,
  not cost-shortest, since real per-jump fuel costs only ever live in a
  tenant's own in-memory `GalaxyAtlas` and are never persisted anywhere
  this public page can read. "Show on map" switches back to the map tab,
  fits the view to the route's systems, and draws it as a dashed violet
  line with its hop systems outlined to match.

## 2026-09-12 (cartography tenant-exploration layer + labels)

- **Added the tenant-exploration layer to `/cartography`**, the piece
  explicitly deferred when the page first shipped. A system is marked
  "explored" once *some* tenant's own fleet has actually visited it and
  populated its waypoints (`galaxy_systems.waypoints` non-empty) — the
  crawler alone only ever learns coordinates/type, never waypoint detail,
  so this is the one bit of real fleet activity visible on the otherwise
  tenant-agnostic crawl map. Explored systems get a subtle green outline
  on the map, toggleable via a checkbox, plus their own "Explored" stat
  tile. New `Store.listGalaxySystemPositions()` field `explored` (a cheap
  `jsonb_array_length(waypoints) > 0` check, not the waypoint blob itself).
- **Added system-symbol labels near each dot once zoomed in far enough**
  that they'd actually be legible — hidden entirely at the whole-galaxy
  view where thousands of overlapping labels would just be noise, shown
  past a zoom threshold (also whenever a search zooms in on a match).
  Same DOM-reuse approach as the dots: each system gets a paired `<text>`
  element once, and only its position/font-size/visibility are touched on
  zoom/pan, not a full rebuild.

## 2026-09-12 (cartography search + zoom)

- **Added system search and zoom controls to `/cartography`'s galaxy map.**
  Typing a system symbol and hitting Go (or Enter) jumps the map to that
  system's neighborhood; unobtrusive +/- buttons and a fit-whole-galaxy
  reset sit in the map's corner, alongside mouse-wheel zoom and click-drag
  panning. Switched the map's dots from being rescaled to fit a fixed
  0-800 box to being drawn at their raw galaxy x/y with the SVG `viewBox`
  doing all the zoom/pan work — panning or zooming no longer re-lays-out
  any dots, only moves the viewBox and rescales dot radius to match.

## 2026-09-12 (public cartography page)

- **Added a public, no-login galaxy map at `/cartography`.** Operator
  request, inspired by another developer's public SpaceTraders cartography
  tool. Built around `GalaxyCrawler`'s existing systems+factions crawl (the
  comprehensive, tenant-agnostic data source) rather than any one tenant's
  own partial exploration — shows a scatter-plot map of every crawled
  system colored by star type, a factions table, live crawl-progress stats
  (systems mapped vs. the galaxy's real total, now tracked via the API's
  own pagination total instead of just counting rows), and a scrolling
  activity log of crawl milestones. New `GET /api/cartography/{systems,
  factions,progress,activity}` endpoints, mounted ahead of `resolveTenant`
  in `src/cli/index.ts` (same pattern as `/api/gate`/`/api/admin`) since
  none of this is tenant-scoped. `GalaxyCrawler` now keeps an in-memory
  ~50-entry activity ring buffer and tracks the galaxy's total system count
  via a new `Client.getSystemsPage()` (captures the SpaceTraders pagination
  `meta.total`, which the generic `get()` helper used to discard). Added
  `Store.listGalaxySystemPositions()`, a lean read (no jsonb waypoint/
  jump-gate blobs) for the map's scatter plot. Tenant-exploration detail
  (markets/shipyards) was considered as a secondary data layer but not
  built in this pass — the crawler's systems+factions data was confirmed as
  the starting point.

## 2026-09-12 (auto keeper probes)

- **A tour ship (or any ship) visiting a shipyard with no keeper
  stationed there now requests to buy a probe on the spot to become
  one.** Operator request. A probe has no fuel and can never move, so
  buying one at that exact waypoint is the only way to plant a keeper
  there at all — this closes the gap where keeper coverage previously
  only ever came from converting an idle miner/shuttle onto a manually
  curated market list, never from a shipyard discovered opportunistically.
  Goes through the same operator approval gate as any other autonomous
  purchase. New doctrine switch `autoKeeperProbes`, on by default —
  turn off in the Book if unwanted. See `docs/TODO.md` for a test-infra
  note (one new test case couldn't be verified live in this session due
  to a transient connection timeout to the remote test database).

## 2026-09-12 (input-reset fixes)

- **Fixed Book page inputs resetting mid-edit too** — same root cause
  as the Markets/ship-detail fix below: `renderBook()` unconditionally
  rebuilds its whole sheet's innerHTML whenever it re-renders for any
  reason, wiping the Discord webhook URL field, co-pilot settings
  fields, and any in-progress numeric policy-value edit. Now skips the
  render entirely while a value chip's click-to-edit input is open (it
  isn't part of the template, so nothing could restore it anyway), and
  snapshots/restores every other input the same way
  `refreshOpenShipDetails()` already does.
- **Fixed inputs resetting mid-edit on Markets and in ship detail
  panels**, on both mobile and desktop (v5/v6). Two separate bugs:
  the price chart's material dropdown's `change` handler read a stale
  closed-over variable instead of the event's actual new value, so
  picking a different material didn't register at all — the next 20s
  poll just restored the old selection, looking like a revert; and
  `refreshOpenShipDetails()` only ever preserved one specific field
  (`.dispatch-wp`) across its full re-render (every 5s while a panel is
  open), so every other input — keeper-market waypoint, the tour-
  dispatch system picker — reset mid-edit on that same cycle. Both
  fixed: the dropdown now reads `e.target.value` and skips unnecessary
  rebuilds, and the ship-detail preservation now covers every input/
  select/textarea in the panel generically instead of one hardcoded
  field.

## 2026-09-12 (autoExplore retry-loop fix)

- **Fixed `autoExplore()` retrying a doomed jump forever.** Found live:
  `DRAGOM-C` retried the identical jump to `X1-YB72` (remote gate under
  construction) every few minutes for 45+ minutes straight. Same bug
  shape as the `exploringEnabled` bypass fixed earlier this session — a
  protection (`exploreSystem()`'s remote-gate construction check and
  skip-list) existed on the dedicated-explorer path but was never
  applied to `autoExplore()`, the parallel path that opportunistically
  borrows an idle tour/scout ship. `canJump()` only validates the local
  gate, so nothing stopped the same unreachable target from being
  reselected pass after pass. `autoExplore()` now filters against
  `gateConstructionSkipUntil` and checks+records the remote gate's
  status before ever proposing the jump, mirroring `exploreSystem()`
  exactly. `tests/fleetNonBlocking.test.ts` covers it directly.

## 2026-09-12 (jump-cost fix + health check)

- **Fixed the cross-system jump-cost bootstrap gap.** `GalaxyAtlas.recordJumpCost()`
  now also fires from `shipProxy.ts`'s shared explore-jump path (the one
  every tour ship and explorer actually uses), not just trader/fleet-
  manager jumps. Previously a real jump's cost — like DRAGOM-D's actual
  jump to X1-RN95 — never lowered `crossSystemLegCost()`'s estimate for
  that gate pair, so every cross-system leg stayed priced against the
  flat 5,000-credit placeholder forever, a closed loop that meant no
  cross-system route could ever become profitable enough to fly and
  correct the estimate. `tests/shipProxy.test.ts` covers the fix
  directly (asserts `recordJumpCost` fires with the local gate,
  destination system, and real transaction price from the JUMP phase).
- **What "tour more systems" actually takes today**, for reference: a
  tenant assigns/buys a Light Shuttle into the `tour` role, then either
  dispatches it to a specific system via the dashboard's Tour Dispatch
  panel (multi-hop auto-jump toward the target, one gate at a time) or
  just lets it roam — `marketTourTargets()`/`shipyardTourTargets()`
  already trait-scan every charted system, not just home. The one hard
  constraint: a tenant can't dispatch its last home-system tour ship
  away (`fleet.ts`'s `dispatchTourShip()` refuses) — keepers only cover
  the home system's big markets, the smaller ones rely on a tour ship
  passing through.
- **Added `GET /healthz`**, mounted ahead of every other route in
  `src/cli/index.ts`, so Render can be pointed at a real health check
  instead of having none configured at all. Existence alone is the
  signal — it always returns 200. Needs the Render dashboard's Health
  Check Path field set to `/healthz` by hand (no API/MCP tool exposes
  that field on an existing service) before it actually changes deploy
  behavior — see `docs/TODO.md`.

## 2026-09-12 (multi-tenant market scoping + UI)

- **Scoped market data and dispatch routes to systems a tenant has
  actually charted.** `market_latest` is a shared table across every
  tenant on this server reset (deliberate — a market's price is a fact
  about the server, not the observer). Nothing filtered reads from it,
  though: DRAGOM's Markets tab was showing prices and "same-system"
  routes for `X1-QV71`/`X1-CN35`, systems it has never sent a ship near,
  priced entirely off other tenants' exploration. `computeDispatchRoutes()`
  and the `/markets`/`/intel` dashboard endpoints now filter to this
  tenant's own `chartedSystems` record. The home system is charted at
  boot, so no regression there.
- **Waypoint labels through the UI now include their system** (e.g.
  "S84-A1" instead of a bare "A1") — now that cross-system operation is
  real, a local waypoint code alone is ambiguous (multiple systems can
  have a waypoint named the same thing). Dropped the now-redundant
  separate system badge next to it in `v5`/`v6`.
- **Root-caused why cross-system trade routes never fly**, even once
  connectivity and cross-system market data both genuinely exist:
  `GalaxyAtlas.recordJumpCost()` — which lowers the estimated cost of a
  cross-system leg once a real jump's price is known — is only wired
  into the trader's and fleet-manager's own jump paths, not the shared
  explore/tour jump path every tour ship and explorer actually uses.
  So every cross-system leg gets priced against a flat, deliberately
  conservative 5,000-credit placeholder forever, which nothing has
  cleared yet — a closed loop, since no cross-system route can become
  profitable enough to fly and record a real, lower cost. Not fixed yet;
  see `docs/TODO.md`.

## 2026-09-12 (live-ops)

- **Lowered DRAGOM's `marginFloor` doctrine value from 20c to 10c**
  (operator change, not a code change). DRAGOM-1's trader had been
  flapping on its own FUEL route for over an hour — the route's real
  margin sat right at 19-20c, so it bounced between viable and rejected
  on every live price tick. Verified via live logs: after the change,
  DRAGOM-1 went from mostly-stuck to 11 successful route pickups across
  FUEL/FOOD/MEDICINE in the following 51 minutes, with zero margin-floor
  rejections and no new failure mode introduced by the looser floor.

## 2026-09-12

- **Documented four API-governance gaps** found while comparing this
  app's rate-limiting design against another developer's SpaceTraders
  app: per-request priority never reaches the shared HTTP rate limiter,
  the limiter's queue has no cap/shedding, mutating API calls have no
  ambiguous-failure/reconciliation safety net, and API capacity isn't a
  doctrine-tunable resource the way credits are. See
  `docs/api-request-priority-plan.md`, `docs/rate-limiter-saturation-plan.md`,
  `docs/ambiguous-mutation-safety-plan.md`, `docs/api-capacity-doctrine-plan.md`.
  Not implemented — proposals only.
- **Explored (and closed) a Kubernetes pod-per-tenant migration.**
  Conclusion: doesn't hold up on cheap managed K8s tiers, since they
  don't solve the actual constraint (SpaceTraders rate-limits by source
  IP, not tenant token) and would replace the in-process priority-queue
  rate limiter with a harder distributed version of the same problem.
  See `docs/k8s-pod-per-tenant-exploration.md`.
- Started this changelog, `docs/TODO.md`, and `docs/adr/README.md` to
  keep multi-threaded work organized going forward.

## 2026-09-11 and earlier (recent highlights)

- `8cd04f0` Rescue stranded ships by jumping when a fuel tender could
  never work — closes a real incident where DRAGOM-C/14 got stuck with
  no reachable fuel tender.
- `7ac2fcc` Tour ships top off fuel at every market, not just when running
  low.
- `e41e648` Fix stranded tour ships never getting rescued — `ShipAgent`
  never self-flagged as stranded in the first place.
- `e416ed4` Fix cross-system holds getting permanently stuck, quietly
  draining tour coverage.
- `db3c473` Fix `autoExplore()` skipping real jump gates it never
  actually loaded.
- `293c504` Fix two exploring-switch bugs: `autoExplore()` bypass and an
  unadopted default.
- `46de3aa` Add operator approval gate MVP, wired into autonomous ship
  buying — a human-in-the-loop gate for consequential engine decisions.
- `5494f03` Block dispatching the last home-system tour ship.
- `3b963b8` Fix vanished sector tabs: union charted systems into
  `/api/state` too.
- `5b0373d` Fix exploring master switch: check `isEnabled()`, not
  `value() === 0`.
- `ec03b9d` Add remote tour ship dispatch: multi-hop auto-jump toward a
  target system.
- `042a33e` Add doctrine controls to pause expensive explorer jumps.
- Persisted open trade positions (`heldRoute`/`heldCost`) across restarts
  and closed a multi-tenant boot-priority gap — see
  `docs/architecture-plan.md` and the held-route persistence work
  (migration `013_held_route.sql`).

For anything before this, `git log` is the record until it's worth
backfilling further.
