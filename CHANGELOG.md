# Changelog

Every notable change, newest first. One entry per merged change, written
for someone who wasn't in the room — what changed and why, not just what
the commit touched. Decisions with lasting architectural weight get their
own ADR in `docs/adr/` (see `docs/adr/README.md`) instead of just a line
here; link it from the entry when that happens.

Backfilled from git history starting 2026-09-12 going back far enough to
be useful context; not a complete project history — see `git log` for that.

## Unreleased

- Nothing pending yet — add entries here as work lands, then move them
  under a dated heading below on the next meaningful checkpoint.

## 2026-09-12

- **Documented four API-governance gaps** found while comparing this
  app's rate-limiting design against another developer's SpaceTraders
  app: per-request priority never reaches the shared HTTP rate limiter,
  the limiter's queue has no cap/shedding, mutating API calls have no
  ambiguous-failure/reconciliation safety net, and API capacity isn't a
  doctrine-tunable resource the way credits are. See
  `docs/api-request-priority-plan.md`, `docs/rate-limiter-saturation-plan.md`,
  `docs/ambiguous-mutation-safety-plan.md`, `docs/api-capacity-doctrine-plan.md`.
  Not implemented — proposals only.
- **Explored (and closed) a Kubernetes pod-per-tenant migration.**
  Conclusion: doesn't hold up on cheap managed K8s tiers, since they
  don't solve the actual constraint (SpaceTraders rate-limits by source
  IP, not tenant token) and would replace the in-process priority-queue
  rate limiter with a harder distributed version of the same problem.
  See `docs/k8s-pod-per-tenant-exploration.md`.
- Started this changelog, `docs/TODO.md`, and `docs/adr/README.md` to
  keep multi-threaded work organized going forward.

## 2026-09-11 and earlier (recent highlights)

- `8cd04f0` Rescue stranded ships by jumping when a fuel tender could
  never work — closes a real incident where DRAGOM-C/14 got stuck with
  no reachable fuel tender.
- `7ac2fcc` Tour ships top off fuel at every market, not just when running
  low.
- `e41e648` Fix stranded tour ships never getting rescued — `ShipAgent`
  never self-flagged as stranded in the first place.
- `e416ed4` Fix cross-system holds getting permanently stuck, quietly
  draining tour coverage.
- `db3c473` Fix `autoExplore()` skipping real jump gates it never
  actually loaded.
- `293c504` Fix two exploring-switch bugs: `autoExplore()` bypass and an
  unadopted default.
- `46de3aa` Add operator approval gate MVP, wired into autonomous ship
  buying — a human-in-the-loop gate for consequential engine decisions.
- `5494f03` Block dispatching the last home-system tour ship.
- `3b963b8` Fix vanished sector tabs: union charted systems into
  `/api/state` too.
- `5b0373d` Fix exploring master switch: check `isEnabled()`, not
  `value() === 0`.
- `ec03b9d` Add remote tour ship dispatch: multi-hop auto-jump toward a
  target system.
- `042a33e` Add doctrine controls to pause expensive explorer jumps.
- Persisted open trade positions (`heldRoute`/`heldCost`) across restarts
  and closed a multi-tenant boot-priority gap — see
  `docs/architecture-plan.md` and the held-route persistence work
  (migration `013_held_route.sql`).

For anything before this, `git log` is the record until it's worth
backfilling further.
